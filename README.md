# Counter-using-HTML
Made a simple counter page using DOM elements (acciojob project)

This counter displays the numbers, when the user clicks on the given buttons.

When the user clicks on the Increment Button, then the counter increases.

When the user clicks on the Decrement Button, then the counter decreases till zero.

If the user tries to click on the Decrement Button after zero, then the page shows warning in red that the counter "cannot go below zero".

There is also a Clear Button which the user can click to reset the counter.
